Problem: sentry-cli seems to read AUTH from sentry.properties (which is committed and thus low permissions), rather than the key I give it in
`sentry-cli login`.

Currently the webpack plugin is commented out because it wants a higher permissions and I haven't worked out how to give it those safely.

By hand, we can do (after temporarily changing the auth in sentry.properties)
`sentry-cli releases files 0.8.0 upload-sourcemaps ./app/ --rewrite`

So far I have not seen this actually give me a source level stack trace. The docs say

> You donâ€™t have to upload the source files (referenced by source maps), but without them the grouping algorithm will not be as strong, and the UI will not show any contextual source.

But those same docs only talk about uploading the map. And my source maps actually have the source embedded, so should that be enough?
